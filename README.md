# Retrospect

At some point during school (not too sure of the year, but somewhere between 1991-1995) 
we started to learn different programming langages with my friend, starting from Basic 
and Pascal and ending with x86 assembler.

I also happened to have ZX Spectrum at home and it's always interesting and 
motivating to try something practical, so picked something which seemed easy 
and fun: https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/4803/ZX-Spectrum/Stack_Up
and tried to more or less clone it in Pascal.

Usage:
```bash
dosbox STACK_UP.EXE
```
