# Retrospect

At some point during school (between 1992-1995) we started to learn different 
programming langages with my friend, starting from Basic and Pascal and ending 
with x86 assembler.

I also happened to have ZX Spectrum at home and it's always interesting and 
motivating to try something practical, so picked something which seemed easy 
and fun: https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/4803/ZX-Spectrum/Stack_Up
and tried to more or less clone it in Pascal. 

Based on code comment, this  happened in '95 :).

Usage:
```bash
dosbox STACK_UP.EXE
```
